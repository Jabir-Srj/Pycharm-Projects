# Pycharm-Projects
Python Notes and Projects from [Python Complete Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/share/101X983@vW97ZTJfd7ggJYPDfgcbbCXCbwPbaC81H7raWn8CknSwY69imWWWn9M3PQlX6WY3RA==/).

Looking forward to making proper projects, for now these are just notes. 

This repo also behaves as my PyCharm IDE config.
